## Major creative work

Your major creative work is worth 60% of your unit total and is made up of four components:

  * Milestone 1: 8%
  * __Milestone 2: 10%__
  * Milestone 3: 12%
  * Viva Exam: 30%

## Milestone 2
### Note: due date is Tuesday 28th of September 2021, at 5:00pm (ie. the second day back from the mid-semester break).

In this assignment you will refactor the program to improve its design without necessarily changing its functionality.  You may fix some bugs along the way, or make the game more to your liking, but the core work is to refactor the code.

You should start from the code published in the ["milestone2" branch of the workshops repository](https://github.com/mq-soft-tech/COMP2000_2021/tree/milestone2/).  We encourage you to make a fresh clone of this branch (in a separate folder on your computer) rather than trying to integrate it with your other work.

### Read the following pages from Chapter 13 of the textbook "Better Living with Patterns"

 * "Who does what?" (page 594), and
 * "Pattern Categories" (pages 595-596)

You'll see that the book organises patters into three *categories*, namely "Creational", "Behavioral", and "Structural".

For the assignment choose *two* design patterns from the book with the following constraints:

  * each of your choices must be a pattern from a __different *category*__.
  * the first pattern must be from those that we have studied so far (ie. up to and including week 7)
  * the second pattern can be any other pattern from the textbook (ie. those listed under "Who does what?")
    * it is your choice if you wish to use the patterns listed for discussion under weeks 8 and 9, or not.
  * both patterns must be taken from "Head First Design Patterns".

## Pattern #1 (25 marks)
There are a number of possible patterns for improving this code. Your job is to identify a pattern **discussed in weeks 6 and 7** that you think is most appropriate and provide a detailed explain of your choice and how it improves your program. For full marks you will need to explain not only how and why your chosen pattern improves upon the existing code, but also how and why it is a better choice than other *suitable* design patterns.

Your submission should include a file `PATTERN1.md` that names the pattern and explains why you chose it


## Refactor (25 marks)

Implement the pattern.  You must be faithful to the pattern as described in the book.  If you _must_ depart from it, then you _must_ describe why this was necessary in a file `DEPARTURES1.md` which names the pattern and the ways you departed from it, as well as explains why you made each change.

# Further Improvements

## Pattern #2 (25 marks)
Choose a second pattern **from "Head First Design Patterns"**, selecting one that is either from those listed for weeks 8 and 9, or from the remaining patterns described in the textbook (remember this *must* be from a different category than the one you have chosen for pattern #1). Again, your job is to identify the one you think is most appropriate and explain why you think this is. And, again,  for full marks you will need to explain not only how and why your chosen pattern improves upon the existing code, but also how and why it is a better choice than other *suitable* design patterns.

Your submission should include a file `PATTERN2.md` that names the pattern and explains why you chose it


## Refactor (25 marks)

Implement the pattern.  You must be faithful to the pattern as described in the book.  If you _must_ depart from it, then you _must_ describe why this was necessary in a file `DEPARTURES2.md` which names the pattern and the ways you departed from it, as well as explains why you made each change.

# Above and Beyond (no marks): ðŸ¤”
Let your imagination go wild, if you have no imagination, you might like to try:

  * Improve the aesthetics of the game.
  * Build some challenging levels

If you attempt this task, include a `ABOVE_AND_BEYOND.md` file explaining what you did.

# Submission

You must submit a zipped VSCode project.  Your maker will download your zip file, open it in VSCode and run it from there.  Please don't submit unnecessary temporary files (such as class files) in your zip file.
